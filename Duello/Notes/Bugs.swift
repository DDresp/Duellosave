//Failed Instagram Request also just when server fails because of the network connection

//NO DEINITING IN THE CATEGORYPOSTFEED

//IF deleting a post, the post also has to be deleted in the reports????

// we should use our own back and forward logic while using navigation stack, because otherwise the coordination will break

//show welcome to duello only at userpostsfeed

//Username not shown in profile

//Check how it is checked wether the user already set the profileSettings Or Not

//MISSING SECURITY RULES

//You have to be careful that if a user created a post, the likes and dislikes should be 0

//You have to implement secutiry rules for a post, allowing users to only increment likes or dislikes of a post and setting the reportStatus to reviewRequested!
