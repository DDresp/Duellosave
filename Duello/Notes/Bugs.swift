//Network error --> Crash of the app, fatal error

//hide instagram post// or show that its disabled if the post isn't available from instagram anymore
//--> Create attribute: IsDeactivated if instagram fails --> set Flag to deactivated and store it in model

//--> disbaled attribute --> retry or reactivate ??
//--> first approach to reactivate --> but possible problem is that it might be falsely claimed to be not working --> too much reactivations needeed, bad user experience
